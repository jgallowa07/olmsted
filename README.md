## Introduction

Nextstrain is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data. We provide a continually-updated view of publicly available data with powerful analytics and visualizations showing pathogen evolution and epidemic spread. Our goal is to aid epidemiological understanding and improve outbreak response.

Resulting data and inferences are available live at the website [nextstrain.org](https://nextstrain.org). Documentation is available at [nextstrain.org/docs](https://nextstrain.org/docs).

## Auspice
